Description: This file is designed to take a CSV file with the top movies of all time. The movies are put in order with the top grossing movie of all time (Avatar) at first, and then the next 799 movies in terms of gross sales.
When ran using the function and parameters of printYears(in_filename, out_filename), this program will generate a new CSV file that gives the gross earnings for blockbuster movies for each year in the file.
I was interested in discovering how COVID-19 affected blockbuster movies, so I then decided to see the year-over-year change in gross movie ticket sales. 
You can see from the program and output, that in 2023 we are still nowhere near the same level of blockbuster ticket sales as in 2019.
